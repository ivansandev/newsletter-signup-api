## Description
This is a small web project built with Node.js (Express.js) and APIs to Mailchip.


## How to run
* Clone the project
* Go to the project's directory and run `npm install` to install or the necessary packages
* Inside the directory, run `node app.js`

## Things I've learned in this project
- Express.js basics
- APIs
- **GET** and **POST** requests
- JSON
- Routing

_Note: The API key expires with time, so the API to Mailchip may not work at the time the app is tested._
